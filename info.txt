player.sendMessage("You feel the obelisk");
player.setNextAnimation(new Animation(8502));
player.setNextGraphics(new Graphics(1308));
WorldTasksManager.schedule(new WorldTask() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        restoreSummoning();
        player.sendMessage("...and renew your summoning points");
    }
}, 2);

This code locks the player for 2 ticks while performing the emote/graphics
restoreSummoning() and player.sendMessage() are executed after the 2 ticks
have passed.
